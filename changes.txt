MV Separation:
	* Storage should be part of the model - We moved storage to the package "model.persistence".
	* Storage had a printout, this was removed.
	* All saving and loading to and from file is now handled through the Register-class and is encapsulated.
OO-Design:
	* Storage now returns a copy of the memberlist.
Code:
	* Namings in the code have had a revamp and no better suits the software, as intended. 
	* Comments have been reduced.
